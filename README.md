# WooCommerce Name Your Price - Sold Individually

### What's This?

Mini-extension for [WooCommerce Name Your Price](https://woocommerce.com/products/name-your-price//) that adds stricter enforcement of "Sold Individually" for NYP items, so that two items of different prices are not allowed to be purchased together.

### Usage

There is nothing to configure. Activating the plugin automatically limits a Name Your Price product to a single instance in the cart.

### Important

1. This is provided as is and does not receive priority support.
2. Please test thoroughly before using in production.
